Application of AI Models for Finding a Winning Strategy in Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was my TIPE (Supervised Personal Initiative Project), which I presented during the engineering school entrance exams.

The objective was to find a winning strategy at Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. The program I coded contains 2 AI models : MinMax with alpha-beta pruning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search.

First, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe in which every square of the grid contains another grid of Tic-Tac-Toe.
To win the game you have to align 3 winnin grids. This version of Tic-Tac-Toe ads difficulty and opens a lot of strategical possibilities.

When the first player starts in the middle square of the middle grid, a winning strategy exists so I forbided this move in my game in order to create new winning strategies.
